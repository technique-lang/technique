making_coffee : Ingredients -> Coffee

# Heading

Ask these questions: are you really sure you want a coffee?

Assuming you do, then:

    1.  { repeat <making_coffee>(e) ~ cups }
        a.  First task
        b.  Second another task
                'Yes' | 'No'
    2.  Do things { exec(
        ```bash
            ./stuff
        ```
        ) }

another_example(e) : Input -> Output
{
    [
        "answer" = 42
        "Question Time" = "What is the question?"
        "timestamp" = now()
        "message" = e
        "interpolation" = "The value is { e }"
    ]
}
